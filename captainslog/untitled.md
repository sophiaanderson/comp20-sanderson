On The House: 

Major steps: 
    1. Figure out how to get data (facebook-- tufts facebook community, twitter, 
    TUSC, tufts.edu events-- speaker series etc)

    2. Figure out how to parse that data into the following:

        Each event should be tagged with
            - category
            - location
            - date/time 
            - "keywords"
            - cost/ if free

    3. This will let us then implement the following features: 
        - search by categories/ title/ keywords
        - share (to twitter, facebook etc)
        - master calender
