  <h1> Homework #4 - Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side of NotUber </h1>
  
    <h2> Introduction: </h2>
        <p> NotUber is a web application that matches users to available vehicles in the area. 
            The client provides their username and current location (lat and lng) to the app,
            which will in turn return the information of the five most recent vehicles and display 
            the locations on the map. This was implemented in assignment 2 (client side) and 3 (server side)
            by John Tagliaferro. The following is a review of the security of this web app. </p>

    <h2> Methodology: </h2>
        <p> Testing was initially carried out using the "black box" technique, where, based on my 
        understanding of the implementation of the app, but without reading the code, I attempted to
        exploit vunerabilities in the program. This was effective, but to find further vulnerabilities, 
        I looked at the source code to pinpoint issues. </p>
        <p> I mainly used curl and postman to issue post/ get requests </p>

    <h2> Abstract of Findings:</h2>
        <p> Generally speaking, the security issues in this program stemmed from blindly trusting the 
        user's input, without checking for special characters, leaving it very vulnerable to 
        attacks that "trick" the program into treating user input as javascript or HTML code. </p>
        <p> I was able to exploit this by sending malicious javascript alerts, alter HTML to 
        make the screen blank, and redirect the heroku app to a youtube video. </p>

    <h2> Issues Found: </h2>
        <h3> Issue: Using XSS Javascript to Send Unwanted Alert</h3>
            <li>Location: /rides </li>
            <li>Severity: high. Manipulation of javascript could cause major issues when used with a more malicious intent</li>
            <li>Description: this was found during the "black box" phase of testing, I suspected that the input wasn't 
            sanitized and would be vulnerable to this type of XSS attack. I used script tags in the post request to issue an alert, 
            as shown in the photo below. </li>
            <li> Proof: </li>
            <div img>
            <img src="img/js_post.JPG" alt="XXS alert">
            <img src="img/js_proof.JPG" alt="proof of alert">
            <li> Resoultion: to fix this issue, a validator/ sanitizer would have ensured that special characters, 
                ex, "<>" would not be allowed, the validator module will remove these potentially malicious characters
                and replace them with reasonable html equivilant. </li> </div>


            <h3> Issue: Injecting HTML </h3>
            <li>Location: /rides </li>
            <li>Severity: medium. This allowed me to drastically change the style of the webpage (ex. not showing any of it), but, this 
            injection did not grant me access to any of the confidential/ potentially harmful data in the site, only to it's visibility</li>
            <li>Description:I used the style tags in the same way as I did in the previous example to style body display as nothing. I 
            did this after I examined the code, and found that the html was very vulnerable. This rendered the webpage completly empty </li>
            <li> Proof: </li>
            <div img>
            <img src="img/html_post.JPG" alt="post request: <style>body{display:none}</style">
            <img src="img/html_proof.JPG" alt="proof of nothing on the webpage"> </div>
            <li> Resoultion: The data needs to be sanatized/ validated! </li> 

            <h3> Issue: Redirect </h3>
            <li>Location: /rides </li>
            <li>Severity: Medium, as before, I was able to cause some chaos, but wasn't granted access to any sensitive data. </li>
            <li>Description: this time, I put js in my post request to redirect the window to a youtube video 
            of my choosing. This makes the website inaccessble.  </li>
            <li> Proof: </li>
            <div img>
            <img src="img/redir_post.JPG" alt="postman code to redirect">
            <video src="img/redir_proof.JPG" alt="video of webpage redirecting"> </video></div>
            <li> Resoultion: Sanatize! </li>
