This GitHub repository holds assignments and labs from Tufts Comp 20: Web Development. 

My favorite assignment was the client-side NotUber, where we used an existing API to 
develop a ride-sharing app. I enjoyed figuring out the Google Maps API and learning 
how HTTP requests work through working through it. 

Throughout the course, I've grown in my problem-solving skills, as programming on the web
has an entirely different set of constraints and issues. I learned how to teach myself 
different web frameworks and using the resources available to me to use them correctly. 
My "tool-belt" has grown greatly this semester. 

The most important thing I learned, broadly, was how the Internet actually work, and
learning what happens when you type in an URL. This helps me to understand how to work
with API's in the future, and gives me the tools to expand my area of expertise. 

In the future, I'm excited to dive into front-end web dev. I really enjoyed working with 
things like bootstrap and I'd like to continue to learn.
